"""
Module for executing functions and tracing back any exceptions.

This module provides a utility function `exec_and_traceback_all_exceptions` that allows you to execute a given
    function while tracing back any exceptions that occur during execution.
    The function will return `True` if no exceptions were raised,
    or the formatted traceback of the last exception encountered.

Functions
----------

.. function:: exec_and_traceback_all_exceptions(fct: Callable, *args, **kwargs) -> Tuple[bool, Any]
    Execute a given function while tracing back any exceptions that occur during execution.

    Args:
        fct (Callable): The function to execute.
        *args: Additional positional arguments to pass to the function.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to pass to the function.

    Returns:
        Tuple[bool, Any]: A tuple containing a boolean indicating whether an exception was raised,
            and the formatted traceback of the last exception encountered if one was raised, or None otherwise.
